@section ghidra_download Ghidra
Ghidra is an extremely useful tool for labeling in game variables & functions, viewing disassembly & decompilation views to help in reverse engineering functions, and much more. It is the the primary disassembler/decompiler we use.
[Here is a link to download Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/download/Ghidra_10.3.1_build/ghidra_10.3.1_PUBLIC_20230614.zip)

Ensure you have a recent version of Java installed.
If you do not, download the latest version of [Java SE Development Kit](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_windows-x64_bin.exe) and run the installer.

In order to use Ghidra with our project, or with any other PS1 game, you'll need to download and install the [Ghidra PSX Plugin.](https://github.com/lab313ru/ghidra_psx_ldr/releases/download/v6.7/ghidra_10.3.1_PUBLIC_20230627_ghidra_psx_ldr.zip)
Ensure that the plugin version matches your Ghidra version. I have linked to matching versions of **10.3.1**
